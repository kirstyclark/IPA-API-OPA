# IPA API OPA!

## A frontend site for the Punk API

Created using React, this site fetches the beers from the Punk API and then offers a range of filtering and ordering methods.
The beers are presented as cards with a graphic of the bottle or keg next to the name and ABV, when clicked the card flips to show a quip about the beer, a description and finally the date it was first brewed.

Filter beers by...
- name
- ABV

Sort beers by...
- name
- brew date
